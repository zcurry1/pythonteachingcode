This is a grade tracking program - think through the goal up front- what is the task and design?
needs to enable several basic functions for faculty members.
This comment in triple quotes is called a docstring.
It is text that explains what a code file (aka module) or function does.

# Like the admins above is a dictionary but of students.
# Dictionaries use curly brackets with colons to associate keys with values.
# In this case, each student's first name is a key. The values are lists of grades.
# Lists are denoted with square brackets.
# Values are indexed within starting with 0 for the first one.
# Each value is separated by commas.
